# Test
Laboratory Assignments

Welcome to my GitHub project. This program was created as part of an assignment.

Below this, I will briefly explain how to download this project and use it. 

# How To Use This Program with Visual Studio
  We will first start with how to run this program using Microsoft Visual Studio. If you don't have Visual Studio on your computer, you can get it from this link:
  - https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/

After that, you will want to click on the green button labeled `Code`.

And with those simple clicks, you will have the source code on your computer. The next thing that you will want to do is extract the files from the ZIP, open Visual Studio and just open the project.
Then just simply ,,Build and run" your program. (Either press ,,Local Windows Debugger" or ,,Start Without Debugging")

# How To Download the Project with GIT

* Then, just copy the link thats under HTTPS.
* Use `Git Bash Here` in the file directory where you would want your project to be cloned.
* After that, type git clone [link] in the console that appeared after using `Git Bash Here`.

# Requirements
